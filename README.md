# Welcome to my profile

Welcome to my profile!<br>Here are some facts about me

## Prefered deployment methods

Common deployment methods I used in the last few years.
| **Technology**                             | **Experience**                                                  | **Preference** |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------:|
| Docker                                     | ![90%](https://tools.kup.tz/image/progress-bar/generate/90.svg) |      ❤ ❤       |
| Serverless - Cloudflare Workers, FaaS      | ![85%](https://tools.kup.tz/image/progress-bar/generate/85.svg) |     ❤ ❤ ❤      |
| Native install                             | ![65%](https://tools.kup.tz/image/progress-bar/generate/65.svg) |                |
| Kubernetes                                 | ![50%](https://tools.kup.tz/image/progress-bar/generate/50.svg) |        ❤       |

I tend to use Drone CI for building and deploying. 

As that is the only CI/CD software I am using I am not adding a different chart to that.

## Prefered languages and frameworks

Both server and client languages and frameworks, mixed.

<small>* got the core concepts, still have to lookup how to group fields and buttons every time</small>

There are some language I haven't used in a while ("AHK" and "Pawn" to name some), but I won't be able to use them right now.<br>So I am not naming them.

I removed "HTML" and "CSS", as (even those are languages too and I didn't specify "programming" in here) they seem a little bit off.
