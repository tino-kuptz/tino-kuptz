# Welcome to my profile

There probably won't be much interesting to see here, as I only host my local projects here as a mirror of my local git.

Anyways - welcome to my profile!<br>Here are some facts about me
## Prefered deployment methods
Common deployment methods I used in the last few years.
| **Technology**                             | **Experience**      | **Preference** |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|:--------------:|
| Docker                                     | ![85%](/img/85.svg) |      ❤ ❤       |
| Serverless (Cloudflare Pages/Workers)      | ![85%](/img/85.svg) |     ❤ ❤ ❤      |
| Native install                             | ![65%](/img/65.svg) |                |
| Kubernetes   <img width="999" height="1">  | ![40%](/img/40.svg) |        ❤       |

I tend to use Drone CI for building and deploying. 

As that is the only CI/CD software I am using I am not adding a different chart to that.
## Prefered languages and frameworks
Both server and client languages and frameworks, mixed.

<small>* got the core concepts, still have to lookup how to group fields and buttons every time</small>

There are some language I haven't used in a while ("AHK" and "Pawn" to name some), but I won't be able to use them right now.<br>So I am not naming them.
